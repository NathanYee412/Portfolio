# Portfolio
Hello! This is my portfolio project built as a front-end practice using ReactJS and Styling from TailwindCSS
This is my first time using TailwindCSS and I am having a great time using it. I have built projects in the 
past using Bootstrap, and learning Tailwind was a matter of reading the documentation and knowing some CSS. 
They have a great system where you can look up which class to use, and implement them without ever leaving 
your JSX file.
